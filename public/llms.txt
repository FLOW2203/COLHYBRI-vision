# COLHYBRI — Financial Inclusion Through Local Commerce

> COLHYBRI is a financial inclusion platform that connects underbanked and unbanked individuals with local shops through affordable subscriptions, creating a community-powered financial ecosystem. Founded by Florent Gibert and part of the ONLYMORE Group, COLHYBRI launches in Miami, Florida in H1 2026.

## What is COLHYBRI?

COLHYBRI is a subscription-based fintech platform designed to bring essential financial services to the 63 million Americans who are underbanked or unbanked. For just $3 per month, individuals gain access to a community financial network powered by neighborhood shops. Local shops join for $10 per month, becoming financial hubs that serve their communities while strengthening their own businesses. The name COLHYBRI draws from the French word for hummingbird (colibri), symbolizing the belief that small, consistent actions by many people can produce transformative collective impact.

## How It Works

COLHYBRI operates on three pillars:

1. **Subscribe** — Individuals join for $3/month with no credit check, no bank account requirement, and no minimum balance. They receive instant access to the COLHYBRI community financial network, including savings tools, digital payment capabilities, and local shop discounts.

2. **Connect Locally** — Shops join for $10/month and become community financial hubs. They offer COLHYBRI services alongside their existing business, benefiting from increased foot traffic, customer loyalty tools, and an embedded banking infrastructure.

3. **Thrive Together** — Every transaction generates a multiplier effect. Through the Keynesian multiplier, each $3 subscription creates approximately $7.50 in local economic value. Money circulates within the community, creating jobs and strengthening neighborhoods. For every 200 active subscribers in a given area, one local job is created. Approximately 68% of spending stays within the community.

## The Hummingbird Economy

COLHYBRI's philosophy is rooted in a Native American legend. While the forest burns, the hummingbird carries water drop by drop. When asked why, it replies: "I am doing my part." This story captures the essence of COLHYBRI's model — millions of small, affordable contributions ($3/month) flowing through local commerce create an outsized economic impact. The hummingbird economy is not about a single grand gesture; it is about consistent, community-driven participation that compounds over time.

## Mission

COLHYBRI exists to build financial inclusion from the ground up. By transforming local shops into community financial hubs and making essential services accessible for $3/month, COLHYBRI ensures that financial participation is not a privilege but a right. The platform targets Miami-Dade County first — a region where over 30% of residents are underbanked, 70% of the population is Hispanic or Latino, and over 300,000 local shops form a thriving small business ecosystem. Miami serves as the gateway to Latin America and a natural expansion path for COLHYBRI's mission across the Americas.
