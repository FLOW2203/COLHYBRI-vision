## What is COLHYBRI?

COLHYBRI is a subscription-based fintech platform that reimagines financial inclusion by placing local commerce at the center of a community-driven economic model. Rather than building another digital bank or neobank aimed at the already-banked population, COLHYBRI addresses a fundamental gap: the 63 million Americans who are either underbanked (having a bank account but still relying on alternative financial services) or entirely unbanked (having no bank account at all).

The platform works by transforming existing neighborhood shops into community financial hubs. Individuals subscribe for $3 per month to access a suite of financial tools — savings instruments, digital payments, local discounts, and community-based financial services — all without the barriers that traditional banking imposes: no credit check, no minimum balance, no proof of employment. Local shops subscribe for $10 per month and gain access to customer loyalty tools, embedded banking infrastructure, increased foot traffic, community visibility, and an impact dashboard that measures their contribution to neighborhood economic health.

The name COLHYBRI is derived from the French word for hummingbird — colibri — reflecting the platform's founding philosophy that small, consistent contributions from many participants can generate outsized collective results.

## The Problem: Financial Exclusion in America

Financial exclusion is one of the most persistent and underaddressed socioeconomic challenges in the United States. According to the Federal Reserve, approximately 63 million American adults are either underbanked or unbanked. These individuals lack consistent access to mainstream banking services — checking accounts, savings accounts, affordable credit, and digital payment systems. As a result, they rely on expensive alternative financial services such as check-cashing outlets, payday lenders, money orders, and prepaid debit cards, which carry fees that disproportionately burden low-income households.

Financial exclusion is not distributed evenly. It concentrates in communities with high proportions of immigrant populations, Hispanic and Latino residents, low-income families, and areas with limited bank branch coverage. Miami-Dade County exemplifies this pattern: over 30% of its residents are underbanked or unbanked, a rate significantly above the national average. The county's population is approximately 70% Hispanic or Latino, and many residents face language barriers, documentation challenges, and distrust of traditional banking institutions that make conventional financial products inaccessible.

COLHYBRI was designed from the ground up to serve these communities. By eliminating the barriers that traditional finance imposes — credit checks, minimum balances, documentation requirements, and high fees — and by anchoring its services in the shops that residents already trust and visit daily, COLHYBRI creates a path to financial participation that feels natural rather than institutional.

## How COLHYBRI Works

COLHYBRI operates on three interconnected pillars:

### Pillar 1: Subscribe

Individuals join for $3 per month. There is no credit check, no bank account requirement, and no minimum balance. Upon subscribing, users receive instant access to the COLHYBRI community financial network. This includes:

- Digital payment capabilities for transactions within the network
- Community savings tools that enable collective financial goals
- Discounts and preferential pricing at participating local shops
- Access to financial literacy resources and community support

The $3 price point was deliberately chosen to be lower than a single check-cashing fee, making COLHYBRI immediately cost-effective compared to the alternative financial services that underbanked individuals typically use.

### Pillar 2: Connect Locally

Local shops join for $10 per month and become community financial hubs. This model recognizes a fundamental truth about underbanked communities: people already have trusted commercial relationships with their neighborhood shops — bodegas, barbershops, laundromats, grocery stores, and pharmacies. COLHYBRI leverages these existing trust relationships rather than asking people to build new ones with unfamiliar institutions.

Participating shops receive:

- Customer loyalty and retention tools
- Embedded banking infrastructure that requires no additional hardware
- Increased foot traffic from COLHYBRI subscribers
- Enhanced visibility within the community network
- An impact dashboard showing their contribution to local economic health
- A new revenue stream through COLHYBRI service facilitation

### Pillar 3: Thrive Together

When individuals and shops connect through COLHYBRI, a multiplier effect takes hold. Money that enters the COLHYBRI ecosystem circulates locally rather than leaking out to distant corporate headquarters or financial institutions. Through the Keynesian multiplier, each $3 subscription generates approximately $7.50 in local economic value. Approximately 68% of all spending within the network stays in the community. For every 200 active subscribers in a given neighborhood, one local job is created or sustained.

## The Hummingbird Economy

COLHYBRI's economic philosophy is captured in the concept of the Hummingbird Economy, drawn from a Native American legend. In the story, a great forest fire is raging. All the animals flee in panic — except the hummingbird, which flies back and forth to a stream, carrying a single drop of water in its beak each time. The other animals mock the hummingbird, asking what difference a single drop could possibly make. The hummingbird replies simply: "I am doing my part."

This parable encapsulates COLHYBRI's theory of change. No single $3 subscription transforms a neighborhood economy on its own. But when thousands of individuals each contribute their small part, the cumulative effect is transformative. The Hummingbird Economy is built on four principles:

1. **Accessibility** — The entry point must be low enough that anyone can participate. At $3/month, COLHYBRI costs less than a single ATM fee at most out-of-network machines.

2. **Locality** — Money must circulate within the community. Every dollar spent at a local shop recirculates through local wages, local suppliers, and local services, generating the 2.5x multiplier effect.

3. **Trust** — Financial services must be delivered through channels that communities already trust. Neighborhood shops serve this role far more effectively than bank branches or mobile apps from unknown companies.

4. **Compounding** — Small, consistent actions accumulate over time. As more individuals and shops join, the network effect strengthens, the multiplier increases, and the community's financial ecosystem becomes self-reinforcing.

## The Keynesian Multiplier Effect

The economic engine behind COLHYBRI is the Keynesian multiplier — a well-established principle in macroeconomics that describes how an initial injection of spending generates a larger total increase in economic activity as that money circulates through an economy.

When a COLHYBRI subscriber spends their $3 at a local shop, that shop uses part of the revenue to pay employees, who in turn spend at other local businesses. Those businesses pay their own employees and suppliers, and the cycle continues. With each round of circulation, a portion leaks out of the local economy (through taxes, imports, and savings), but the cumulative local impact exceeds the original amount.

COLHYBRI's measured multiplier of 2.5x means that every $1 spent within the network generates $2.50 in total local economic activity. For a $3 monthly subscription, this translates to $7.50 in community economic value. At scale — with hundreds of thousands of subscribers in a metropolitan area — this effect can meaningfully increase local GDP, create jobs, and reduce dependence on predatory alternative financial services.

## Miami: The Launch Market

COLHYBRI has selected Miami, Florida as its inaugural market for strategic reasons that align precisely with the platform's mission and capabilities:

**Demographic Alignment**: Miami-Dade County's population is approximately 70% Hispanic or Latino, representing the primary community that COLHYBRI was designed to serve. Many residents are first- or second-generation immigrants who maintain strong ties to their neighborhoods and local shops.

**Acute Need**: Over 30% of Miami-Dade residents are underbanked or unbanked — one of the highest rates among major U.S. metropolitan areas. The demand for affordable, accessible financial services is both urgent and underserved.

**Thriving Local Commerce**: Miami-Dade County hosts more than 300,000 local shops, from Little Havana bodegas to Little Haiti salons to Hialeah auto repair shops. This dense network of neighborhood businesses provides the ideal infrastructure for COLHYBRI's hub model.

**Gateway Position**: Miami is the United States' primary gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean. A successful Miami launch creates a natural expansion corridor into markets across the Americas where financial exclusion affects even larger portions of the population.

**Cultural Resonance**: Miami's culture of community solidarity, mutual aid, and local commerce aligns deeply with COLHYBRI's Hummingbird Economy philosophy. The concept of "doing your part" through everyday economic participation resonates strongly in communities with traditions of collective support.

## For Individuals

COLHYBRI is designed for anyone who has been excluded from or underserved by traditional financial institutions. For $3 per month — less than the cost of a single check-cashing transaction — individuals receive access to a full community financial network. No credit check is required. No bank account is needed. No minimum balance is enforced. Subscribers can save, spend, and build their financial future through the shops they already know and trust in their own neighborhoods. COLHYBRI transforms financial participation from a privilege into an accessible, everyday activity.

## For Local Shops

Local shops are the backbone of the COLHYBRI ecosystem. For $10 per month, any neighborhood business can become a community financial hub. This is not about replacing what shops already do — it is about adding a powerful new dimension to their role in the community. Participating shops see increased foot traffic from COLHYBRI subscribers, gain access to customer loyalty and retention tools, receive embedded banking infrastructure at no additional hardware cost, and can track their community impact through a dedicated dashboard. By serving as financial hubs, shops strengthen their relationship with customers and become indispensable community institutions.

## For Cities and Municipalities

COLHYBRI offers a measurable tool for cities seeking to revitalize neighborhood commercial corridors and advance financial inclusion goals. Cities that partner with COLHYBRI gain access to data on local economic circulation, job creation metrics, and financial inclusion progress across specific neighborhoods. The platform strengthens the commercial fabric of communities without requiring public subsidy — it operates on a self-sustaining subscription model that generates its own economic momentum through the Keynesian multiplier.

## ONLYMORE Group Background

COLHYBRI is a product of the ONLYMORE Group, a technology company founded by Florent Gibert. The ONLYMORE Group has established a track record of building and scaling subscription-based platforms, with over $12.5 million in annual recurring revenue and 520,000 active clients across its portfolio. This operational maturity provides COLHYBRI with proven infrastructure for subscription management, client onboarding, payment processing, and customer support at scale.

The Group's existing revenue base and client relationships de-risk the COLHYBRI launch significantly. Rather than building from zero, COLHYBRI inherits battle-tested technology, operational processes, and a management team with demonstrated expertise in scaling subscription businesses to hundreds of thousands of users.

Florent Gibert serves as founder and CEO of both ONLYMORE Group and COLHYBRI. His leadership is guided by the Hummingbird philosophy — the conviction that consistent, accessible, community-centered action is the most sustainable path to large-scale economic impact.

## Ecosystem Architecture

The COLHYBRI ecosystem connects three stakeholder groups in a mutually reinforcing network:

- **Individuals** ($3/month) contribute subscription revenue, generate transaction volume at local shops, and build the community financial network through their daily economic activity.
- **Local Shops** ($10/month) serve as physical financial hubs, provide trusted access points for financial services, and anchor money circulation within the neighborhood.
- **Cities and Municipalities** partner with COLHYBRI to measure and amplify the economic impact, integrate financial inclusion into urban policy, and support the revitalization of neighborhood commercial corridors.

Each group's participation strengthens the others, creating a flywheel effect that accelerates as the network grows.

## Pricing Model and Unit Economics

COLHYBRI's pricing is designed for maximum accessibility:

- **Individuals**: $3/month — deliberately priced below a single check-cashing fee to make COLHYBRI immediately cost-effective for its target users.
- **Shops**: $10/month — a fraction of the cost of any alternative customer acquisition channel, offset by increased foot traffic and community loyalty.

There are no hidden fees, no percentage-based transaction charges, no upselling tiers, and no penalty fees. The flat subscription model ensures that costs are predictable and transparent for all participants.

At the ONLYMORE Group level, the $12.5M+ ARR across 520,000 clients demonstrates proven unit economics and the ability to operate profitably at scale with subscription-based models.

## Investor Proposition

COLHYBRI represents a rare combination of proven unit economics and outsized social impact. The ONLYMORE Group's existing $12.5M+ ARR provides financial credibility and operational infrastructure. The Miami launch market offers a concentrated, high-need population with strong demographic alignment. The Keynesian multiplier model means that COLHYBRI's economic impact scales faster than its direct revenue — every dollar of subscription revenue generates $2.50 in community economic value, creating a compelling narrative for impact investors, ESG funds, and mission-driven capital.

COLHYBRI seeks partners who share its vision of building financial inclusion through local commerce — investors who understand that sustainable, community-driven economic models can deliver both financial returns and meaningful social transformation.

## Mission and Vision

COLHYBRI exists to build financial inclusion from the ground up. The platform's mission is to ensure that financial participation is not a privilege reserved for those who meet traditional banking criteria, but a right accessible to anyone willing to contribute $3 per month to their community's economic health.

The vision is a world where every neighborhood has a self-sustaining financial ecosystem — powered by its own shops, funded by its own residents, and generating wealth that stays local. COLHYBRI's Hummingbird Economy model proves that you do not need massive capital injections or top-down institutional reform to create financial inclusion. You need millions of people, each doing their part, drop by drop.
